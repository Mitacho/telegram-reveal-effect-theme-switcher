# Telegram theme switch reveal effect

## _a weekend challenge_

Create a reveal theme switch effect like Telegram is not perfectly possible yet because it is not possible to take a screenshot that perfectly matches what is shown on the screen by using the dom-to-image library. This library does not render the correct font family and break word in a button for example.
